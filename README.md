# Important Notice
This project is being undertaken solely for the purpose of personal practice and to enhance my skills in the Go programming language.

Following a four-day study of the fundamental concepts of Golang through Eko Kurniawan Khannedy's "Programmer Zaman Now" YouTube channel, I am now starting to undertake a basic project using the language.

Based on the title that I have presented, I will be creating a Telegram bot intended for facilitating commercial transactions.
